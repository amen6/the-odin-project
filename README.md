# TheOdinProject

## Description
The Odin Project *(also known as TOP)* is an open source community and curriculum for learning full-stack web development. Students of The Odin Project build portfolio projects and complete lessons that are constantly curated and updated with links to relevant resources.

The curriculum is divided into two distinct paths, each covering the subject language in depth, it's either *Javascript* or *Ruby on Rails*. Each path contains a listing of lessons *-articles or videos-* interspersed with multiple projects. These projects give the students the opportunity to practice what they are learning, so they will develop and solidify the theoretical knowledge learned in the lessons. Some projects may be included in the student's portfolio.

## My Experience

Odin isn't easy ofcourse, did i enjoyed it? probably anyone interested in programming will, is it beneficial? no doubt, you will be able to see yourself developping by time. There will be many times that you will get stuck and may question your ability to learn programming, but with persistence you'll get it.

After finishing **Html & Css** in **Javascrpit path** you will be versed in **Html & Css** and cloning any website will be so easy for you, you will learn to search your problems, ask peoples, communicate with others developers when being stuck, you will really notice a big developpement in yourself after finishing it. There's one bad side i noticed in odin, some of the articles in the assignment are kind off repeated, so will you go wasting your time reading the same informations.

You will also learn about **Sass** *-Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet-*, which is a *CSS pre-processor*, it lets you use features that do not exist in CSS, like *variables, nested rules, mixins, imports, inheritance,* built-in functions, and other stuff. And also you do a project using **Sass**.
